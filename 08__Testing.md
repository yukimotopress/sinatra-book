## Using Rack::Test

Testing is an integral part of software development. In this section we will
look into testing the Sinatra application itself. For unit testing your models
or other classes, please consult the documentation of frameworks used
(including your test framework itself). Sinatra itself uses Contest for
testing, but feel free to use any framework you like.

Bryan Helmkamp's [Rack::Test](https://github.com/brynary/rack-test)
offers tools for mocking Rack request, sending those to your application and
inspecting the response all wrapped in a small DSL.

### Firing Requests

You import the DSL by including `Rack::Test::Methods` into your test
framework. It is even usable without a framework and for other tasks besides
testing.

Imagine you have an application like this:

```ruby
# myapp.rb
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  "Welcome to my page!"
end

post '/' do
  "Hello #{params[:name]}!"
end
```

You have to define an `app` method pointing to your application class (which is
`Sinatra::Application` per default):

```ruby
begin
  # try to use require_relative first
  # this only works for 1.9
  require_relative 'my-app.rb'
rescue NameError
  # oops, must be using 1.8
  # no problem, this will load it then
  require File.expand_path('my-app.rb', __FILE__)
end

require 'test/unit'
require 'rack/test'

class MyAppTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  include Rack::Test::Methods

  def app
    Sinatra::Application
  end

  def test_my_default
    get '/'
    assert last_response.ok?
    assert_equal 'Welcome to my page!', last_response.body
  end

  def test_with_params
    post '/', :name => 'Frank'
    assert_equal 'Hello Frank!', last_response.body
  end
end
```

### Modifying `env`

While parameters can be send via the second argument of a get/post/put/delete
call (see the post example above), the env hash (and thereby the HTTP headers)
can be modified with a third argument:

```ruby
get '/foo', {}, 'HTTP_USER_AGENT' => 'Songbird 1.0'
```

This also allows passing internal `env` settings:

```ruby
get '/foo', {}, 'rack.session' => { 'user_id' => 20 }
```

### Cookies

For example, add the following to your app to test against:

```ruby
"Hello #{request.cookies['foo']}!"
```

Use `set_cookie` for setting and removing cookies, and the access them in your response:

```ruby
response.set_cookie 'foo=bar'
get '/'
assert_equal 'Hello bar!', last_response.body
```

### Asserting Expectations About The Response

Once a request method has been invoked, the following attributes are
available for making assertions:

 * `app` - The Sinatra application class that handled the mock request.

 * `last_request` - The
 [`Rack::MockRequest`](http://rdoc.info/gems/rack/1.2.1/frames/Rack/MockRequest)
 used to generate the request.

 * `last_response` - A
 [`Rack::MockResponse`](http://rdoc.info/gems/rack/1.2.1/frames/Rack/MockResponse)
 instance with information on the response generated by the application.

Assertions are typically made against the `last_response` object.
Consider the following examples:

```ruby
def test_it_says_hello_world
  get '/'
  assert last_response.ok?
  assert_equal 'Hello World'.length.to_s, last_response.headers['Content-Length']
  assert_equal 'Hello World', last_response.body
end
```

### Optional Test Setup

The `Rack::Test` mock request methods send requests to the return value of
a method named `app`.

If you're testing a modular application that has multiple `Sinatra::Base`
subclasses, simply set the `app` method to return your particular class.

```ruby
def app
  MySinatraApp
end
```

If you're using a classic style Sinatra application, then you need to return an
instance of `Sinatra::Application`.

```ruby
def app
  Sinatra::Application
end
```

### Making `Rack::Test` available to all test cases

If you'd like the `Rack::Test` methods to be available to all test cases
without having to include it each time, you can include the `Rack::Test`
module in the `Test::Unit::TestCase` class:

```ruby
require 'test/unit'
require 'rack/test'

class Test::Unit::TestCase
  include Rack::Test::Methods
end
```

Now all `TestCase` subclasses will automatically have `Rack::Test`
available to them.
